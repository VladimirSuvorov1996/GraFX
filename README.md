# GraFX

GraFX is a header-only libraries set based on glfw3 and providing the same set of features as exact glfw3 and additional features such as loading graphics from files. The main difference between glfw3 and GraFX is that GraFX is OOP-designed and mostly uses Modern C++ (11, 14, 17) features in opposite to the pure C-styled library glfw3.

WARNING: The project is under active development is in a pre-alpha version, therefore it has uncomplete functionality, and (somewhere) it's organized in unstructured order and there is a lack of tests, documentation and examples. Please notice, that all those problems are temporary and will be fixed in fututre versions.
